# Google-scholar-search
This brief script will open your web browser with the top five search hits for Google Scholar.

This contains two files: a Python file (which is the code that completes the desired task) and a Windows batch file (so it can be run from the command line).

I put the batch file into a directory that is listed in my computer's PATH. This way, if I want to seach something, I merely go to the command prompt, type "scholarly" and my search terms. The program then automatically opens my webbrowser plus five tabs (one tab for each of the top five hits).

I created this so that I could get varied practice in learning to program automation.
